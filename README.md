# Prepare Machine
### First we need to update our Nuc's bios from XXXX ---> 0089.
To do that we need to download the bios updater from [Intel's Webpage](https://www.intel.la/content/www/xl/es/products/sku/126150/intel-nuc-kit-nuc8i3beh/downloads.html) and Download the first One as a windows executable (.exe / .msi)
